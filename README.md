# Accept for C++

[![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~ekoeppen/accept.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~ekoeppen/accept?)

`accept` is a simple line editing library primarily aimed at embedded targets
for C++. It works currently in minimal mode where only backspace is supported.

`accept` handles one character at a time, and writes data using an output object.
